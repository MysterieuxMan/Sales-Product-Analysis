# Sales-Product-Analysis
This project is dedicated to a data-driven project that aims to assist the inventory and marketing teams at Kalbe, a leading pharmaceutical and healthcare company, in optimizing their operations. The project has two main objectives:

1. Daily Sales Prediction:
The inventory team's primary goal is to optimize stock management by accurately predicting daily product sales. This repository contains code and resources related to data collection, preprocessing, and the development of machine-learning models for predicting daily sales. These models help ensure that Kalbe maintains optimal inventory levels, reducing overstock and understock situations.

2. Customer Segmentation and Personalized Marketing:
The marketing team's objective is to enhance customer engagement and increase sales by providing customized promotions and personalized sales experiences. The repository includes code and resources for customer segmentation based on various criteria, such as demographics, purchase history, and behaviour analysis. This segmentation allows for targeted marketing campaigns and tailored sales strategies for each customer segment.
